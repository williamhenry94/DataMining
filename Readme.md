# How to run the code

All of these codes are for preprocessing the dataset and we use R to get the association rule. However, it is majorly for Crime dataset and Unemployment dataset

1. Place the dataset on datasets_csv folder
2. Requirement:
    - Python 3.6 or above
    - pip installation
    - Pandas (**pip install pandas**)
    - Numpy (**pip install numpy**)
3. Every R code will go to R folder.
    - Terminal: **The environment should be able to detect the R compiler**
        * Go to the R folder
        * ```Rscript --vanilla association_rule_mining.R```
4. The R code relies on csv dataset so. You can edit the filepath on line 5 of the code.

**Note for the CPI-Crime data codes (R/Python), they are on CPI branch of this git repo!!!!**
